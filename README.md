# IBM Plexâ„¢ Sans font Magisk Module
original font repo:

https://github.com/IBM/plex

# Testing devices:
* OnePlus X with LineageOS 14.1 (Android 7.1.2)

* Samsung Galaxy Tab Pro 8.4 (a.k.a. mondrianwifi/SMT-320) with LineageOS 13.0 (Android 6.0.1)

# Known issues:
* The colon in the lockscreen clock seems like it is missing and shows up as a unknown unicode block symbol.
* In the Settings app, "Wi-Fi" shows up as "Wi_Fi"
* In the Calculator app, pressing the INV (inverse functions) button, some superscript characters are missing for some funtions (specifically the inverse minus sign and exponential x).

Some glyphs used by Android are not currently included in IBM Plex. Hence some are missing, or look different.
When IBM Plex gets updated with new glyphs, this module will get updated.
